LangChain:
    2018 
    Integration with major LLM apis
    Provides 
        Prompt Template Abstraction
        Major Embedding Models
        Vector Stores 
        Vector Indexes
        LangSmith platform
            debug, test, deploy, monitor AI
        LangGraph platform
            deploying and scaling LangGraph agents 

SDK vs LangChain
    SDK although would be more granular, more updated would be specific to model/set of Model

LLM Terms
    Temperature 
    max_tokens
    Chat Models
        for dialogue chatting with models
    Completion Models
        for text completion

Prompting
    Adapting an existing LLM for your task is called prompt engineering.

Prompting Technique 
    1. Zero-Shot Prompting
    2. CoT Prompting
        Chain-of-thought
        ReAct Paper from Google
    3. RAG 
        Retrieval-Augmented Generation
    4. Tool Calling
        Passing function along with prompt to help LLM 
    5. Few-Shot Prompting 
        Provide sample question/answer to get specific type of answer 
        Type 
        1. Static Few-Shot Prompting
            Basic: giving small number of examples
        2. Dynamic Few-Shot Prompting 
            Out of set of assembled dataset, dymanically picking example to include in prompt 

*Combine multiple prompting technique to get better results
