Stages of AI Project for LLMs:
    1. Scope and Usage Definition
    2. Data Collection
            Data Sources
            Preprocessing
            Augmentation
    3. Model Selection/Build from Scratch
    4. Training                                            (Here Training means post training as we are only referring to model that are already trained)
